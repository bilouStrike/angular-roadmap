[Angular Visual Roadmap 🗺️🎯](https://www.onepin.io/progress/Complete-Angular-Roadmap:-From-Fundamentals-to-Enterprise-Level-Development-6838400970239f677e7c53dd)

## Milestone 01: Angular Basics & Setup  
> Learn the core concepts of Angular, including TypeScript, components, data binding, and the Angular CLI.

### Unit 01: Introduction to Angular  
> Understand what Angular is and set up your development environment.  
- What is Angular and why use it?  
- Differences between Angular, React, and AngularJS  
- Installing Node.js and Angular CLI  
- Creating your first Angular project  
- Angular file structure overview  
- Practical exercise: Create and run your first Angular "Hello World" app using CLI.

### Unit 02: TypeScript Essentials  
## Learn the TypeScript features used extensively in Angular.  
- Basic types, interfaces, and enums  
- Classes, constructors, and access modifiers  
- Functions and arrow syntax  
- Generics and decorators  
- Practical exercise: Create a simple TypeScript class with interfaces and decorators.

### Unit 03: Components and Templates  
> Dive into the building blocks of Angular applications.  
- Creating components with CLI  
- Component metadata: selector, template, style  
- Inline vs external templates  
- String interpolation and property binding  
- Practical exercise: Create a profile card component using property binding.

### Unit 04: Directives and Pipes  
> Use Angular's built-in directives and pipes for dynamic templates.  
- Structural directives: `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`  
- Attribute directives: `ngClass`, `ngStyle`  
- Built-in pipes: `date`, `uppercase`, `currency`, `json`  
- Creating custom pipes  
- Practical exercise: Build a product list with filters and formatting.

## Milestone 02: Angular Services & Routing  
> Learn how to manage logic and navigate between views using services and routing.

### Unit 01: Services and Dependency Injection  
> Understand the role of services and how Angular handles DI.  
- Creating and using services  
- Providing services in root/module/component  
- Dependency Injection hierarchy  
- Practical exercise: Create a user service to fetch and share user data.

### Unit 02: Angular Routing  
> Set up navigation in your single-page Angular app.  
- RouterModule and route definitions  
- Navigation using routerLink and `navigate()`  
- Route parameters and query params  
- Child routes and lazy loading  
- Practical exercise: Build a multi-page blog app with dynamic post routing.

### Unit 03: Forms in Angular  
> Handle user inputs using both Template-driven and Reactive forms.  
- Template-driven forms with `ngModel`  
- Form validation and error handling  
- Reactive Forms with `FormBuilder` and `FormGroup`  
- Custom validators  
- Practical exercise: Build a login and registration form with validation.

### Unit 04: HTTP Client and APIs  
> Connect your Angular app to a backend using `HttpClient`.  
- Using `HttpClientModule`  
- Making GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests  
- Observables and `subscribe()`  
- Error handling and interceptors  
- Practical exercise: Fetch and display data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).

# Milestone 03: Advanced Angular Concepts  
> Explore RxJS, module architecture, lifecycle hooks, and component communication.

### Unit 01: Angular Modules and Lazy Loading  
> Organize your app using Angular modules and performance techniques.  
- Feature modules and SharedModule  
- Lazy loading modules  
- Barrel files for cleaner imports  
- Practical exercise: Split a blog app into multiple lazy-loaded modules.

### Unit 02: Component Communication  
> Learn different ways Angular components share data.  
- `@Input()` and `@Output()` decorators  
- ViewChild and ContentChild  
- Service-based communication  
- Practical exercise: Create a shopping cart using parent-child communication.

### Unit 03: Lifecycle Hooks and Change Detection  
> Understand the component lifecycle and when to run specific logic.  
- Common hooks: `ngOnInit`, `ngOnChanges`, `ngAfterViewInit`, `ngOnDestroy`  
- Change Detection strategy  
- Practical exercise: Track user actions using lifecycle logs.

### Unit 04: RxJS in Angular  
> Leverage reactive programming with RxJS for async operations.  
- Observables, Subjects, and BehaviorSubject  
- Operators: `map`, `filter`, `mergeMap`, `switchMap`  
- Using RxJS with `HttpClient` and forms  
- Practical exercise: Build a live search feature with debounceTime and switchMap.

## Milestone 04: State Management, Testing, and Deployment  
> Get ready for real-world production apps with testing, deployment, and advanced tools.

### Unit 01: State Management with NgRx  
> Manage application state with NgRx (Redux for Angular).  
- Introduction to Redux pattern  
- Store, Actions, Reducers, Selectors  
- Effects for handling async  
- Practical exercise: Build a counter app using NgRx.

### Unit 02: Testing Angular Applications  
> Write robust unit and integration tests.  
- Jasmine and Karma basics  
- Writing unit tests for services and components  
- TestBed and mocking dependencies  
- End-to-end testing with Protractor or Cypress  
- Practical exercise: Write tests for a form component and a service.

### Unit 03: Performance Optimization  
> Improve your Angular app’s speed and efficiency.  
- Lazy loading and preloading strategies  
- ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
